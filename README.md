# Particle Identification Challenge

Assignment 2, COMP9417: Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification). The challenge is to build an algorithm that quickly reconstructs particle tracks from 3D points left in the silicon detectors. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.0+ either locally or in a virtual environment
- Datasets from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/data)

### Installing

The only external package that is required is provided by the following github repo:

```
pip install git+git://github.com/LAL/trackml-library.git
```

Next, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/XifeiNi/TrackML.git
```
