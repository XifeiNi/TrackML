# TrackML
1. set up trackML library 
2. experiment with that library
Deadline is Wednesday 11:59PM


Goal:
1.have a basic understanding of the problem by reading relevent posts
2.think of potential algo
3.propose any problems on group chat

Time Line:
the first days: to becom familar with topic and relevant algo
the first week: get a working solution: we at least need to submit on kaggle to get a basic ranking
Cecilia and Al will write problem statement in LaTeX. 
the second week: TBA

# Particle Identification Challenge

Assignment 2, COMP9417: Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification). The challenge is to build an algorithm that quickly reconstructs particle tracks from 3D points left in the silicon detectors. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.0+ either locally or in a virtual environment
- Datasets from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/data)

### Installing

The only external package that is required is provided by the following github repo:

```
https://github.com/LAL/trackml-library
```
